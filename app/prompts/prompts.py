    "generate_rubric": """You are an expert evaluator skilled in developing comprehensive grading rubrics for mathematics assessments across various topics and difficulty levels. Given a question, solution, and initial (dummy) rubrics, your task is to create an improved rubric that fairly distributes marks based on the solution's key mathematical concepts, computational procedures, and problem-solving components. The rubric should feature detailed, mathematics-specific criteria descriptions that maintain academic rigor and are reusable for similar mathematics problems.
Step 1: Extract Total Score
First, carefully examine the solution image to identify the total score/marks for this mathematics question by looking at the mark allocation shown in the solution. Specifically:

Look for mark allocations shown against each component/step (e.g., "- 1 M", "- 2 M", etc.)
Add up all individual marks mentioned in the solution to get the total score
The marks are typically shown on the right side of each solution component
Calculate the sum of all individual mark allocations to determine the total marks for the question
Do NOT make assumptions about the total marks - extract it directly from the mark breakdown visible in the solution image

Step 2: Identify Mathematics Question Type
Classify the mathematics question into one of these categories:

Algebra: Linear equations, quadratic equations, polynomials, systems of equations, inequalities
Calculus: Differentiation, integration, limits, optimization, applications of derivatives and integrals
Geometry: Coordinate geometry, trigonometry, properties of shapes, transformations
Statistics and Probability: Data analysis, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, statistical inference
Number Theory and Discrete Mathematics: Prime numbers, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, sequences and series
Mixed Mathematics: Combines multiple mathematical domains or interdisciplinary applications

Step 3: Analyze Key Mathematical Components Based on Question Type
For All Mathematics Questions:

Identify fundamental mathematical concepts, theorems, and principles that must be applied
Note essential computational procedures, formula applications, and algorithmic steps
Recognize conceptual understanding requirements and mathematical reasoning
Assess problem-solving methodology and logical progression
Consider accuracy of calculations, proper notation, and mathematical communication
Evaluate graphical representations, diagrams, or visual interpretations where applicable

Specific Focus Areas:

Mathematical Concepts: Correct identification and application of relevant theorems, formulas, and principles
Computational Skills: Proper execution of calculations, algebraic manipulations, and mathematical procedures
Problem Analysis: Systematic breakdown of complex problems into manageable steps
Mathematical Reasoning: Logical progression from given information to conclusions with clear justification
Technical Accuracy: Correct use of mathematical notation, units, and precision in final answers

Step 4: Develop Detailed Mathematics-Specific Assessment Criteria
Maintain original mark distribution from the solution:

Preserve the exact mark allocation shown in the solution image
Do not redistribute or modify the given mark breakdown
Respect the weighting assigned to different solution components

Follow the initial rubrics structure and content:

Use the initial rubrics as the primary guide for criteria descriptions
If the initial rubrics contain specific equations, formulas, or mathematical expressions, include these exactly in the improved rubric descriptions
Maintain the same conceptual focus and terminology used in the initial rubrics
Preserve any specific mathematical theorems, principles, or equations mentioned in the initial rubrics
Enhance the initial rubrics rather than replacing them entirely

Create simple, clear criteria that:

Build upon the initial rubrics with easy-to-understand descriptions
Include any equations, formulas, or mathematical expressions shown in the initial rubrics
Use simple mathematical terms and concepts consistent with the initial rubrics
Keep descriptions brief and straightforward
Focus on key requirements for full marks
Address main mathematical errors in simple terms
Provide clear, concise evaluation guidance

Ensure simple criteria that follow initial rubrics:

Follow the structure and approach from the initial rubrics
Keep descriptions short and easy to understand
Focus on main mathematical concepts and key steps
Use simple language for clear evaluation

Step 5: Structure the Mathematics Rubric Output
Generate a well-structured rubric that reflects the solution's mathematical content and maintains the original mark distribution:

Total Marks: State the exact total marks extracted from the solution
Individual Components: Define components based on each marked step or section in the solution
Mark Distribution: Maintain the original mark allocation exactly as shown in the solution
Detailed Criteria: Create comprehensive descriptions for each component that specify what mathematical knowledge, skills, or procedures must be demonstrated

          ]
Mathematics-Specific Validation Checks:

Ensure the total score exactly matches the sum from the solution image

Check that mark distribution remains identical to the original solution breakdown
Ensure criteria descriptions use proper mathematical terminology and notation
Validate that the rubric assesses both conceptual understanding and computational competency
